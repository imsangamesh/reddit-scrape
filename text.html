        Lately, I've noticed a bunch of folks throwing shade at feminists,
        especially women. It's kinda bugging me because feminism is basically
        all about equal rights for everyone. Some of my friends are like, "Why
        not just call it equality if it's about everyone being treated the
        same?" Others have brought up this "meninism" thing.There are many words
        where "man" or "men" is used (like 'man-made,' 'mankind,' etc). Bro,
        let's leave feminism for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cuz, hey, feminism started because women were getting a raw deal, and
        guys were usually the privileged ones. So, why even suggest "meninism"
        when dudes are already pretty privileged? Let's leave some space for
        women and other genders, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, I know there are some pseudo- feminists as well and the
        concept of feminism has evolved over time, as all ideologies do. Ideas
        change with time and space.
      </p>
      <p>
        First-wave feminism focused on issues like women's suffrage and legal
        rights. Second-wave feminism, for instance, addressed reproductive
        rights, workplace discrimination, and sexual liberation. We are still
        working towards these goals, and some people perceive it as unfair to
        men in certain ways (HOWWW? ) Subsequent waves have continued to expand
        the scope of feminist activism to include issues like intersectionality,
        LGBTQ+ rights, and global gender equality. I know that feminism is not a
        monolithic ideology, and there are various perspectives and approaches
        within the feminist movement.Feminism often challenges traditional
        gender roles and norms, As Simone de Beauvoir said, one is not born a
        woman, but becomes one that means women and men are conditioned into
        gender roles by cultural conventions and we have to start somewhere in
        order to have autonomy over self.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, I am not here to defend any particular school of
        feminism because everyone is entitled to their opinions and the right to
        uphold their ideologies. It just bums me out when I see people hating on
        feminism, especially when it's coming from women. And I am trying to
        understand the other side of it which I may have missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what's your take on why some people aren't feeling the love for
        feminists?
