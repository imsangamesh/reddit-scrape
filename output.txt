I have always been in love with him and was quite happy that he came back, but also very careful because of the way he ended things with me last time. We had been dating for 2 years, out of which one year I was severely depressed and struggling with self harm and addiction. We had a very codependent relationship, I would call him everytime I had a panic attack and he was there for me too. This obviously had a toll on his mental health and when I attempted suicide he left me for his own sanity, which was fair. He was very well aware that him leaving at that moment meant it could be the last time he'd ever saw he. He knew I'd die, I knew I'd die and I almost did too. But somehow I survived. We went no contact  for 6 months because I couldn't stand seeing his face or talking to him, in between when we did have a conversation or two he was just very mean to me and he'd ask me to leave him alone. When he broke up with me he told me it's just a break and he will be back in 4 mons, so I'd get drunk and call him asking when will he be back to which he once said he's never coming back and that broke my heart all over again. With time i got better I found ways to deal with my mental illnesses, people around me could see it. I got off the meds too, and controlled drinking somewhat. I wasn't self harming anymore. It was visible that I was okay. We randomly ran into each other at a cafe after all this time and started talking again. He asked for another chance. Asked me on a date and I said yes cause I never stopped loving him. We started seeing each other again. We set boundaries and talked about our expectations. He asked me to give him space and told me his career is his priority, I told him I respect that. He told me he couldn't marry someone, I convinced myself I don't want to get married either (I have no idea if I want to or not, I like some aspects of it and hate others), he said he can't live with me in the long run and I told him I'm not okay with that,  so he agreed to compromise there. Now we've been dating for 3 months and the problems we're having might be considered small or insignificant in most relationships, but since we have this whole history I can't help but be paranoid. Also given that after me he had a thing with the girl he told me not to worry about, all while planning that he wants to get back with me. Now, He occasionally says mean things to me, he ignores my texts A LOT, and I've told him that I don't like it its frustrating and It makes me feel like he doesn't care about me. he refuses to say that he loves me, while he wants me to think that he does, he said he needs time for that and it's been a long time now. And I've come to notice that i just can't open up to him about my sadness anymore, I'm not completely cured, I have bad days, he used words like pity party, victim mentality and it really offended me. He then apologizes when I point em out, he acts all cutesy like nothing was ever wrong.  He doesn't tell me about his problems and I get to know them only when I point out something is wrong. I keep thinking about if this is normal or we just doomed from start. Or am I the problem, cause I've been the problem for a long time. He ignores my texts I tell myself I will not text him now but just reply to when he texts me, this is my mentality, the worst part is when I do that, things seem to be going fine and as soon as I get back to my talkative personality I get ignored again.

I grew up in an orthodox family with a very conservative father who always told me that it\'s the girl\'s responsibility to protect themselves from the opposite gender. How you\'ll ask? By dressing modestly(I\'m talking salwar kameez and dupatta for a 12 yr old), by not speaking to members of the opposite gender, by not sounding too confident or voicing your opinion too loud and of course by never going out unaccompanied(not even to our own terrace). Now since I moved out of my hometown for college and now job, I realised how sexist,unfair and disgusting this thought process is. I\'ve since had several debates with my father on this but soon realised it\'s pointless. He would make statements like \'taali ek hath se nhi bajti kbhi\' and \' aadmi ko uksaoge to vo to jaanwar hi h\'. Recently, I moved back home for a while and I\'m seriously frustrated with how he keeps lecturing me about this stuff every single day.This morning he explained to me how the sight of my bare calfs(mind you I was wearing full length PJ\'s which might have slid up a bit while I was sleeping) might incite someone.I was enraged and seriously just wanted to pack my bags and leave. I want to tell him that his lectures are all bullshit bcoz even though I followed everything he said, I was sexually assaulted, molested and raped. The first time I was touched inappropriately was when I was freaking 13.Ironically, I was moslested by a family member preaching the same principles.I was raped in college. Catcalled and eve teased several times just like all other females. None of those times did i wear anything inappropriate or "incite" the perpetrators but i still thought it was somewhere my fault because it was ingrained in my mind k taali ek hath se nhi bajti.

I just want to let him know how much damage he has caused but can\'t because it\'ll hurt him. And honestly, somewhere deep down i fear that even if i tell him all this, he might somehow justify and shift the blame on me and this will break my heart because I love him so much. I don\'t want to lose all respect for him.

But trust me, this is the best thing I ever did for my digital privacy. Nothing beats this. Basically, aliasing is like you create a random email address which is linked to your primary email (Gmail or proton) and you share/make an account with that random email. So, you never share your actual email with anyone and that random email forward any incoming mail to your primary email inbox (Gmail or proton). You are secure by not sharing your email and another benefit is like if you're not going to use that account anymore or some companies make it impossible to delete the account or change email, we can simply just delete that random email in a second. I used to get so much spam before, but now I control all my emails, I just simply close that random email or stop receiving the mail (you can start again receiving mail if you haven't deleted the random email). Spam mails get rejected automatically as I keep email receiving from some websites like Zomato off and whenever I want to use the email, I simply toggle it on. There are two services for this-", 'Anonaddy', '&', 'Simple Login', ". Both offer free plan, but different way, so read their FAQ. But Anonaddy is so cheap, if you want this much of control, definitely go for this service if you don't want to spend much. Simple Login is great too, and it's now a Proton family part, so security is even more, but it's relatively expensive, but for that price you get a very user-friendly UI and Proton reliability that service will remain active. Point to note - Both of these services support PGP (It's an encryption) and Gmail still in 2023 doesn't support PGP, so you won't be able to encrypt the mails that these services will forward to your Gmail inbox.
